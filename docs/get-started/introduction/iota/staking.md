# Staking in the IOTA Network Ecosystem

in 2021, IOTA introduced a new network that exists next to the main network: the Shimmer staging network. This marks a historical event and a vast increase in utility for the IOTA token.
Shimmer has its own native token: SMR. With the _tokenomics_ and incentive structure around Shimmer, it is possible to stake tokens.

There are several ways to stake your tokens and earn staking rewards:

- Shimmer pre-launch staking to create the initial token supply for SMR and distribute it to those who stake their IOTA tokens.
- SMR token staking to help testing on the Shimmer network and to support the network.

## Shimmer Pre-launch Staking

This staking period was designed to reward IOTA token holders for their participation and distribute Shimmer tokens to them. It also created the total initial supply of the Shimmer network.

Starting from 28th December 2021, IOTA token holders who held their tokens in the Firefly wallet and who chose to participate in the staking period generated Shimmer tokens for 90 days.

### IOTA Staking for SMR Rewards

Shimmer, the staging network and battlefield for IOTA's core technology innovations was bootstrapped purely from IOTA token stakers. The initial token supply of the Shimmer network only relied on the amount of IOTA tokens staked for Shimmer in the 90-day staking period. 80% of the initial supply was distributed to IOTA token holders, while the remaining 20% was distributed equally between the Community DAO and the Tangle Ecosystem.

- The staking functionality in the Firefly Wallet was used for Shimmer.
- Shimmer tokens were distributed at a fixed rate of `1 SMR per 1 MIOTA per milestone`.

- With the launch of the Shimmer network, the generated Shimmer tokens were distributed to IOTA stakers. The distribution was implemented as a functionality within the Firefly wallet.
