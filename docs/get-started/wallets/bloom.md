# Bloom Wallet

Bloom is a desktop wallet developed by former team members of Firefly, the IOTA Wallet. It includes both Shimmer and ShimmerEVM in the same software wallet, so its users can seamlessly transfer assets and cryptocurrency between L1 Shimmer and L2 ShimmerEVM without any outside third-party tooling. Over time, Bloom will support the entirety of the IOTA DLT ecosystem, integrating both Shimmer and IOTA networks in a single app experience.

Also in the pipeline are releases including dark mode; an address book; IOTA network and token support; IOTA and Shimmer governance frameworks; and expanded EVM support (ERC-721, ERC-1155, ERC-4361).
